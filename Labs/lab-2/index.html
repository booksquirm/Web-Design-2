            <h1>Welcome to Capybara Paradise</h1>
            <h2>Come relax and explore the world of the chillest rodent on Earth.</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine a laid-back, oversized guinea pig chilling by the water. That's the capybara, the world's largest rodent tipping the scales at a human-like weight! Despite their hefty size, they're agile swimmers, holding their breath for up to 5 minutes and even napping underwater. Talk about aquatic chill! But what makes them truly unique is their social butterfly lifestyle. Their groups welcome all kinds of feathered friends, from herons hitching a ride for a sunbathe to toucans snacking on ticks off their backs. It's a floating fiesta of friendship!

                Forget the squeaky image of a regular rodent, capybaras are the epitome of chilled vibes. Their unique set of vocalizations includes purrs, barks, and even whistles, forming a complex language understood only by their group. And if you thought guinea pig teeth were impressive, capybara chompers never stop growing! This built-in salad bar ensures they can munch on their favorite all-you-can-eat buffet: grass. So next time you think of "rodent," picture a friendly giant, chilling by the water and welcoming all creatures great and small â€“ that's the true capybara magic!
